## Add a timer

Now you're going to add a timer so that the player only has ten seconds to catch as many ghosts as possible.

\--- task \---

Crea una nuova variabile chiamata 'tempo'.

\--- /task \---

\--- task \---

Can you add a timer to your Stage to give your player only 10 seconds to catch ghosts?

Il tuo timer dovrebbe:

+ Partire da 10 secondi
+ Contare alla rovescia ogni secondo

Il gioco dovrebbe interrompersi quando il timer raggiunge lo 0.

\--- hints \--- \--- hint \--- `When the green flag is clicked`{:class="block3events"}, your `time`{:class="block3variables"} variable should be `set to 10`{:class="block3variables"}. It should then `change by -1`{:class="block3variables"} every second `until it reaches 0`{:class="block3control"}. \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here are the code blocks you need to use: ![ghost-sprite](images/ghost-backdrop.png)

```blocks3
stop [all]

< [ ] = [ ] >

set [time v] to [10]

change [time v] by (-1)

(time)

wait (1) seconds

repeat until < >
end

when flag clicked

```

\--- task \---

Ask a friend to test your game. How many points can they score?

\--- /task \---

Se il gioco Ã¨ troppo facile, puoi:

+ Dare al giocatore meno tempo
+ Ridurre la frequenza con cui i fantasmi appaiono
+ Rimpicciolire i fantasmi

\--- task \---

Change and test your game a few times until you're happy with its level of difficulty.
