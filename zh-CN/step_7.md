\--- task \---

新建一个叫“时间”的变量。

\--- task \---

你能为舞台添加一个计数器，只给玩家10秒钟去捕捉尽可能多的幽灵吗？

计时器应当：

+ 初始设置10秒
+ 每秒钟倒计时

The game should stop when the timer gets to 0.

\--- hints \--- \--- hint \--- `When the green flag is clicked`, your `time` variable should be `set to 10`. It should then `change by -1` every second `until it reaches 0`. \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here are the code blocks you will need to use: ![screenshot](images/ghost-timer-blocks.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here's how to add the timer to your game: ![screenshot](images/ghost-timer-code.png)

\--- task \---

Ask a friend to test your game. How many points can they score?

\--- /task \---

If your game is too easy, you can:

+ Give the player less time
+ Make the ghosts appear less often
+ Make the ghosts smaller

\--- task \---

Change and test your game a few times until you're happy that it's the right level of difficulty.
