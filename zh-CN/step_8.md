## 挑战：更多元素

Can you add other objects to your game?

![screenshot](images/ghost-final.png)

When you're adding an object, you need to think about the following things.

+ How big is it?
+ Will it appear more or less often than the ghost?
+ What will it look/sound like when it has been caught?
+ How many points will the player score (or lose) for catching it?

If you need help adding another object, you can reuse the steps above!
