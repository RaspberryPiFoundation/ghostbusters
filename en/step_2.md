Add code to your ghost sprite so that the ghost appears and disappears forever when the green flag is clicked.

Once the `green flag is clicked`{:class="block3events"}, your ghost should `hide`{:class="block3looks"} for `one second`{:class="block3control"} and then `show`{:class="block3looks"} for `one second`{:class="block3control"}. It needs to do this `forever`{:class="block3control"}.
