`When the green flag is clicked`{:class=”blockevents”}, your `score`{:class=”blockdata”} variable should be `set to 0`{:class=”blockdata”}. The Stage is the best place to add this code. `When the ghost sprite is clicked`{:class=”blockevents”}, the `score`{:class=”blockdata”} should be `changed by 1`{:class=”blockdata”}.
