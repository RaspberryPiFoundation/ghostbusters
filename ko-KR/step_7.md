Now you're going to make your game more interesting by keeping score!

\--- task \---

Create a new variable called `score`{:class="block3variables"}.

[[[generic-scratch3-add-variable]]]

\--- /task \---

\--- task \---

Can you keep track of the player's score? Players should score points when they click on ghosts to catch them.

`When the green flag is clicked`{:class="block3events"}, your `score`{:class="block3variables"} variable should be `set to 0`{:class="block3variables"}. 무대는 이 코드를 추가하는 가장 좋은 곳입니다.

`When the ghost sprite is clicked`{:class="block3events"}, the `score`{:class="block3variables"} variable should be `changed by 1`{:class="block3variables"}.
